# JS-Notebook

## Purpose

1. Learning
    - Always wanted to learn JavaScript 
    - My bachelor's did not focus on JS and once I found this Guide/Tutorial I though it was the perfect oportunity 
2. Curriculum
    - I always heard that JS offers a lot of oportunities and so I decided that it would fit nicely in my belt of skils
