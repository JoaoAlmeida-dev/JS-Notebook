# JS-Notebook

A notebook to hold my mini projects that I am making in order to learn and practice Javascript
The first one is a youtube course which guides me through 15 projects by FreeCodeCamp.org and John-Smilga

## Purpose

1. Learning
    - Always wanted to learn JavaScript 
    - My bachelor's did not focus on JS and once I found this Guide/Tutorial I though it was the perfect oportunity 
2. Curriculum
    - I always heard that JS offers a lot of oportunities and so I decided that it would fit nicely in my belt of skils
